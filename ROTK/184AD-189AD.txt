NOTE: This is 100% based the C.H. Brewitt Taylor translation of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"
		historical novel attributed to author Luo Guanzhong and suspected to have been written sometime between 1300AD and 1400AD.
		The novel is itself based on "Records of the Three Kingdoms" written by Chen Shou sometime between 263AD and 280AD.
		The novelization ("Romance") takes certain liberties with its source material, including oral history and legend. After all, 50 to 100
		years passed between the actual events and those written in "Records" and more than 1000 years between "Records" and "Romance".
		From my limited research, "Records" does not detail movement quite as granularly as "Romance". My assumption is that the
		novelization attempts to "fill in the blanks" of "Records", this also assuming the author of "Romance" didn't have access to
		more granular documentation of troop movements, etc, if such things ever existed.
		As such, this work is not to be mistaken for an accurate historical account of character movements, but rather an attempt at
		supplementing a work of historical fiction to give fans another resource for immersion and understanding.

NOTE: Locations are listed in the order mentioned in the book, unless otherwise noted.

NOTE: Characters are assumed to be in the last known location until otherwise noted.

NOTE: There are 5 Chinese seasons which correspond (maybe?) as such:
	Spring - March through June
	Summer - June and July
	Late Summer - August
	Autumn - September through November
	Winter - December through February

			Eunichs are assumed near the Emperor unless otherwise noted.
			Characters, including royal family, not introduced within relative reading proximity are intentionally unaccounted to avoid assuming too much.
